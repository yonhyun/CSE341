MIPS CALCULATOR
Using MIPS, Impelemented Calculator.

This calculator takes strings as input and parses the strings into real numbers or operators.

To implement the priority of the operator, I used stack data structure.

The expression entered string should be stored at the address 0x1000000010 in memory as a string of ASCII bytes, terminated by null (the binary value 0).
